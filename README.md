Drag to select and automatically recognize letters and numbers

Simple OCR is a lightweight Chrome extension for fast text recognition on webpages.

Important: this extension recognizes only uppercase letters (A-Z) and numbers (0-9).
It does not support lowercase letters, Chinese characters, or other symbols.

How it works:
1. Click the extension icon.
2. Drag to select any area on the current page.
3. The extension captures that area and recognizes uppercase letters and numbers.
4. The result is shown in an on-page panel and copied to your clipboard automatically.

Key features:
- Drag-and-select OCR on any webpage
- Recognition scope: uppercase letters (A-Z) and numbers (0-9) only
- Automatic copy to clipboard
- On-page result panel with quick manual copy
- Lightweight and simple UI

Privacy:

- It only uses the permissions required for capture, recognition, and copy.
